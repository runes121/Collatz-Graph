# Collatz-Graph
Uses the collatz conjecture in python and creates a graph representing how long it took to get the number to 1.

This python file works out a given range of numbers using the collatz conjecture, which is explained nicely in this video here (https://youtu.be/094y1Z2wpJg).

It uses matplotlib to generate a graph visualising the results.
